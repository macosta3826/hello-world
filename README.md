Hello!

Just following the guide that Codecademy took me to for Intro to Git. I'm digging this so far, coding is a fun diversion. Definitely recommend either lo-fi or cello music in the background. Makes this whole thing much more immersive.

Anyways, I started this whole thing because it was a free offering by my company to introduce employees to coding. Not sure if I will do anything with the knowledge, but hey it's good for the resume. Possibly.
